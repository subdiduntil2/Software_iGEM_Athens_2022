# Model Section


# Description

This folder includes the scripts written by Team Athens for the modeling simulations of PERspectives. In particular, we have the following

1. senders_model_all.ipynb for the theoretical simulations and model fit of the senders population (for RBS_LuxI=BCD2)
2. receivers_oplo_all.ipynb for the theoretical simulations and model fit of the receivers population (OpLo construct)
3. receivers_pfr_all.ipynb for the theoretical simulations and model fit of the receivers population (PFR construct)
4. proof_all.ipynb for the simulation of the fitted models for a sample dataset 
5. receivers_modeling_eng.ipynb for the parametric analysis of OpLo receivers construct during the 1st engineering cycle(https://2022.igem.wiki/athens/engineering)
6. sender_all_receivers.ipynb for the comparison of all receiver's constructs during the 2nd engineering cycle(https://2022.igem.wiki/athens/engineering)

# Installation

Users will only have to install the lmfit python package via the packages_model.sh file to perform the model fit of the different constructs in the scripts 1 to 3.

# Usage

All python notebooks already include all the graphs displayed on the [Model](https://2022.igem.wiki/athens/model), [Proof of Concept](https://2022.igem.wiki/athens/proof-of-concept) and [Engineering Success](https://2022.igem.wiki/athens/engineering) sections of our wiki page.
