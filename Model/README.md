# Model Section


# Description
This folder includes the scripts written by Team Athens for the modeling simulations of PERspectives. In particular, we have the following

1. senders_model_all.ipynb for the theoretical simulations and model fit of the senders population (for RBS_LuxI=BCD2)
2. receivers_oplo_all.ipynb for the theoretical simulations and model fit of the receivers population (OpLo construct)
3. receivers_pfr_all.ipynb for the theoretical simulations and model fit of the receivers population (PFR construct)
4. proof_all.ipynb for the simulation of the fitted models for a sample dataset 
5. receivers_modeling_eng.ipynb for the parametric analysis of OpLo receivers construct during the 1st engineering cycle 

# Installation 
Users will only have to install the lmfit pythom package via the packages_model.sh to perform the model fit of the different constructs in the scripts 1 to 3.

# Usage
All python notebooks already include all the graphs displayed on the Model, Proof of Concept and Engineering Success sections of our wiki page.
