# Application Section

# Description

This folder includes the scripts and files needed in order to install the PERspectives Application. In particular, we have the following files:

1. application.py, which is the main file needed to be run. It includes the perceptron algorithm, the User Interface as well as the functions for the update and the delete modes on the RBS Library
2. Three sample datasets: test_dataset_1.csv, test_dataset_2.csv and cancer_dataset.csv which could be then imported by users via the UI of the Application. Those are the same datasets used by our team during the development of the application, as well as in the section regarding the proof of our [entire model](https://2022.igem.wiki/athens/model).
3. application_RBS_dataset.csv, which includes the initial RBS Library designed and characterized from Team Athens. It is a needed file for the applciation to be run properly since it is being used to correlate software weight values with TIR values. However, users are given the ability to modify the file when updating or deleting RBS sequences via the application UI

# Installation

Required packages to be installed are included on the packages_app.sh file

# Usage 

Extended usage of our application can be seen on the [software page](https://2022.igem.wiki/athens/software) of our team where we display the use of the app for training on the cancer dataset.
